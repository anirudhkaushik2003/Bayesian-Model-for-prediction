# Continual learning with Bayesian model based on a fixed pre-trained feature extractor
 - My implementation for the paper [Continual learning with Bayesian model based on a fixed pre-trained feature extractor.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s44267-023-00005-y)
 - Implemented from scratch and comparable results reported after training on the ISIC2019 dataset using the Incremental Implicitly Refined classification setup (without the hierarchy) using an imagenet feature extractor
