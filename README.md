# Continual learning with Bayesian model based on a fixed pre-trained feature extractor
 - My implementation for the paper \href{https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s44267-023-00005-y}{Continual learning with Bayesian model based on a fixed pre-trained feature extractor}.
 - Implemented from scratch and comparable results reported after training on the ISIC2019 dataset using the Incremental Implicitly Refined classification setup (without the hierarchy) using an imagenet feature extractor
